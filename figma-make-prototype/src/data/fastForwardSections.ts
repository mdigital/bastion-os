Customers can scan QR codes and see exactly where every material came from, how it was made, and the environmental impact at each stage.</p><p><strong>The Proof:</strong> Third-party certifications from B-Corp, Climate Neutral, and Fair Trade. We didn\'t self-proclaim sustainability – we earned verification from the toughest independent auditors.</p>',
